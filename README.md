# GlacierBot
I run a community discord server for my youtube channel Glacier Nester, (hence the bot's name) and found myself curious how difficult it would be to write a bot that acts as a music DJ.
After a bit of digging, I found that there is a java discord API, called D4J. Additionally, this api provides support for an audio player library that can play directly from youtube.
However, ordinary music bots are a dime-a-dozen, and I wanted a unique bot that would potentially be useful to folks outside my own discord.
A coworker of mine noted that a great deal of my youtube content is easily consumed as pure audio, and the idea hit me.
I could, rather than writing a simple bot that requires the user to go get a youtube URL to play the sound, simply have something that searches my own youtube backlog for the given title.
A cursory glance at the youtube API makes clear that you can, in fact, search for a video with results only arising from certain users.
So, this bot is my attempts at creating that automated response system, not to mention an exercise in learning to use new API. 
I'll include the link to invite the bot in this description, once I have the bot up and running properly.
